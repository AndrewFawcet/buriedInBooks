    Ida looked at the little box house she had made. It was a pale brown like gingerbread with two windows and a small door on the front. She had carefully painted colourful lines on the roof and around the windows. The door was a pale blue colour and a little bit bigger than her thumb. She picked up the house with her arms wrapped around and carried it onto the school bus. It was a bit awkward getting on the bus and Ida put the house down on the seat beside her. “Brrm brrm” went the school bus as it started driving away from school.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida was happy to see her Mum waiting for her at the end of the street. The big yellow bus pulled over and Ida carried the house off the bus. It was a bit heavy to carry and Mo the bus driver helped Ida carry her gingerbread house down the bus steps. Ida ran over to her Mum being careful not to drop the house she was carrying. Ida stopped beside her Mum puffing and panting. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Her Mum asked, “What have you got there Ida?” Ida was a bit out of breath from running and had to pause for a second to catch her breath. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida still puffing a bit said, “I made a gingerbread house at school today, Mum, can you see how carefully I have painted it?” 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    “Wow that is amazingly well made”, said her Mum, “is it actually made off gingerbread?”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    “No, it’s not silly”, said Ida to her Mum, “it just looks like gingerbread.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    It was a warm day, and Ida was getting hot and tired from carrying the house.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida said, “can you help me carry the house please Mum, it is getting very heavy?”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    “Of course, Ida” Mum said and taking care not to drop the house took the gingerbread house out of Ida’s arms and carried it for her.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida was very hot now and she took off her jumper and tied it around her waist. It was a lovely day in late summer. The trees were a deep green colour. A blackbird swooped into a nearby tree and chortled away.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida said, “Let’s go home Mum.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Mum making sure she had a firm grip on the house started to walk back up the street. Ida skipped along beside her, making sure not to step on a crack, because oh dear, if she stepped on a crack, she would have to marry a rat!
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    They got home and Mum carefully carried the house inside for Ida. It was a bit awkward, so Ida had to open the back door for Mum. Ida quickly tapped in the code to unlock the back door and held the door open for her Mum. They put the gingerbread house down on the dining table and they went into the kitchen to get a big glass of juice. It was a warm afternoon, and the sun was just about touching the treetops in the west. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    A bit later they were reading a book together when Dad came home. He was surprised to see a gingerbread house on the dining table in the house. Ida explained she had made it at school that day. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Her Dad said “That is amazingly well made, the roof is a lovely colour. Did you make all of it yourself?”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida said “yes, I made the whole house at school. It took hours! It’s a gingerbread house you can tell by the colour of the walls.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Dad looked a bit confused, he asked “so is it made of gingerbread?”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida said “no silly! It’s just the colour I have painted the walls.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Both Mum and Dad were looking at Ida, so she explained a bit further, “the house is the colour of gingerbread so people can eat gingerbread inside of it.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Mum and Dad smile at the answer, and Mum asked, “so who would be eating gingerbread inside the house?” 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida thought carefully for a minute. The she said, “it’s a gingerbread house for anybody to eat gingerbread inside. But I think it would be mainly for fairies to use.” Ida paused and thought for a bit more, “and sometimes chipmunks too if they are not busy gathering acorns.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Her Dad said “wow! That is an amazing house.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Mum said “I agree it is so well made. Now time for dinner”, and Mum zipped off to the kitchen to serve up dinner. It was spaghetti for dinner and it smelled delicious. Grumble grumble went Ida’s stomach.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    They ate together just as the sun was setting. Ida made sure to separate her spaghetti and sauce, it was better that way.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    It was getting late, and it was time for bed. Ida stood up and did a big yawn and an even bigger stretch. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida was very tired and said “Mum, I’m going to bed now.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    “Ok Ida” Mum said, “I’ll pop into your room in a second to check you are tucked in. Now what shall we do with the gingerbread house?”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida scratched her head and thought about it. The gingerbread house was sitting in the middle of the room on the dining table. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida had a good idea and said, “we should put it just outside the back door, just in case the fairies want to use it tonight."
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Mum said, “that’s a really nice idea Ida, and it’s such a lovely evening I’m sure they could use it.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Dad chimed in “yes that’s a great idea Ida, I’ll bet the fairies are going to be very hungry tonight.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida could tell that her parents didn’t really believe in fairies, she could tell by the way her parents smiled and nodded. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Dad picked up the gingerbread house and Ida went with him to make sure it was placed correctly just outside the back door. Ida had a sudden brainwave. She ran inside and grabbed a very tiny piece of gingerbread from the kitchen. She put it in a snack container and ran back outside where she placed it down beside the gingerbread house. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Dad said to Ida “I hope that doesn’t get eaten by mice.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida smiled and said, “no its not for mice it’s for the fairies, they are going to be very hungry tonight.” 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida let out a big yawn and rubbed her eyes. She was getting very sleepy. Ida said, “I’m going to bed now.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida could hardly keep her eyes open as she brushed her teeth. She then slowly walked down the hall to her room, stumbled into her pyjamas, and she tumbled into bed.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    She was just about fast asleep when her Mum checked on her. “Goodnight Ida”, Mum said. Mum checked the curtains were closed and softly stepped out. Ida fell into a deep sleep. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida woke up in the middle of the night. She lay still as moonlight streamed through a gap in the curtain. It was a full moon, and the moon was huge and very bright. Ida did not feel sleepy at all, it was a bit strange, she wondered what had woken her up. The house was quiet and down the hall she could just hear her parents gently breathing. She shuffled over and peeped out of a crack in the curtains. The hedge in front of the neighbours was very bright in the moonlight. She breathed gently watching the leaves in the moonlight. Something caught her eye, it looked like a small flashing light. It flashed for a moment purple and blue and disappeared. Ida held her breath and watched very carefully. There was no one there and everything was still and serene,
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Being as quiet as a mouse Ida got up. She tiptoed to the door of her room. She opened her door and listened for sounds. Ida could just hear her parents breathing down the hall and nothing else. Ida padded down the hallway, being careful to avoid the creaky spots on the floor. Ida went to the back door and peeped out through the glass. The garden was very still in the moonlight. She could see her gingerbread house just beside the back door. Nothing was moving. She was just about to go back down the hallway when she suddenly saw a flash of flash of purple light on the corner of the gingerbread house. She stood very still and watched. There was another flash of light, this time red! It seemed like someone was opening and closing the door to the gingerbread house. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida slowly and silently opened the back door. She stepped outside in her pyjamas. The night was a little bit chilly, but not cold. Ida stepped thorough the cool night air and stood beside the gingerbread house. Ida noticed the little container of gingerbread was now lying empty beside the house.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    “Hello?” Ida whispered and tapped on the side of the gingerbread house. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Not a thing moved, it seemed very quiet. Suspiciously quiet!
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    “Hello it’s me Ida”, Ida said and made one more tap on the side of the house. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Suddenly the tiny front door flew open, and a chipmunk poked their head out the door.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    “squeakitty squeak”, said the chipmunk.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida was absolutely amazed, she did not expect a chipmunk to be inside the gingerbread house. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida took a step back and said “I’m very sorry I didn’t meant to startle you Mr Chipmunk.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida was just about to go back inside the back door when the tiny gingerbread house popped door opened again. This time a little purple fairy’s head popped out. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    “Hello”, said the purple fairy “Sorry about Max startling you before. He was a bit angry about something else. That is why he opened the door and squeaked at you like that.” 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida was even more amazed, a chipmunk and now a purple fairy taking to her! Ida asked “It’s ok I didn’t even know Max was a bit angry. Can I ask what was wrong with Max?”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    The purple fairy stepped out of the house, now standing in the cool grass in the moonlight. The purple fairy was about two fingers tall and very beautiful. The purple fairies wings were almost see-through and pink at the ends. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    The purple fairy said “well Ida, poor Max the chipmunk had lost two acorns he had gathered up today. So, when we divided up the gingerbread you had left for use, Max had eaten his piece and was still hungry.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida thought for a second then said “shall I get another piece of gingerbread for you? I think there is more in the kitchen.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    The purple fairy smiled and said, “it’s ok, Max will find plenty of acorns tomorrow, he’s always finding and losing acorns.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    The gingerbread door suddenly opened and Max the chipmunk poked his head out the door. “Squeakitty squeak squeak squeak” Max said.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida didn’t speak squirrel but could tell that Max thought it a very good idea to have more gingerbread.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida said, “I think Max likes the idea of more gingerbread.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    The purple fairy smiled and said “that is pretty much exactly what Max said. He loves eating that chipmunk.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida quiet as a mouse went back into the house. She paused for a second in the dark kitchen, moonlight was washing in through the windows and faintly she could hear her parents sleeping peacefully. Sitting on the kitchen bench under a cloth was the gingerbread. She cut a nice big slice of gingerbread for Max and covered the loaf again with the cloth.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Holding the big piece of gingerbread in her hand and being even quieter than a mouse Ida want back outside. The grass was soft under her bare feet and the moon was high and huge overhead. The gingerbread house was still and the door was closed. Had she imagined everything? Had the chipmunk and the fairy left? She tapped very lightly on the side of the gingerbread house, holding her gingerbread in the stillness of the night.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    The door flew open and out popped not one fairy but two! There was the purple one with the pink tipped wings, and also a blue one who’s wings were tipped with white. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    The purple fairy said, “hello Ida! We had some visitors while you were inside the house. Come out and say hello Max and Rex.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Two chipmunks ambled out of the front door their whiskers twitching, they sat down beside the fairies their tiny paws resting on their fuzzy tummies.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida was amazed, “hello all of you, very nice to meet you. How did you know my name?”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    The purple fairy smiled and winked “there is a fairy to every back garden, making sure the chickens are ok and the dew drops on the flowers are just right. Of course, I know your name Ida, I’ve been here for many moons watching the flowers grow.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida smiled and said “thank you purple fairy for all your hard work the flowers look wonderful. I’ve also bought another piece of gingerbread.” Ida leaned forward and held out the gingerbread.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    The purple fairy gave a tinkling laugh, that sounded like small crystal bells and said “thank you so much Ida, I’ll bet Max and Rex will be very pleased”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Tentatively Rex stepped forward. Ida gave him the piece of gingerbread. Rex squeaked with delight as he held the gingerbread, it looked huge in his fuzzy little paws.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    The purple fairy said, “thank you again Ida, that is very kind.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida smiled and said, “you are very welcome, now I need to get back to bed.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida tiptoed back to the house and just at the door she turned around. The two chipmunks and the two fairies were standing outside the house in the moonlight. They all waved when they saw Ida looking back. It looked so peaceful in the moonlight. Ida waved back and turned and stepped inside. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Inside Ida could hear her parents breathing as they slept. Ida very softly closed the back door, she heard the latch closing with a click.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Being like a ninja and not bumping into anything Ida went back to her room and hopped into bed. The sheets were still warm as she snuggled into them, and she could see a line of moonlight coming through a crack in the curtains. Ida drifted off to sleep and dreamed of dancing in the moonlight.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida woke up the next day to the delicious smell of waffles. It was Saturday morning and Ida could hear her Mum in the kitchen. Her tummy rumbled and she sat up in bed, rubbed her eyes and got up. Time for breakfast.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    In the kitchen Mum served up a crispy waffle with syrup. Mum said “looks like someone slept in this morning Ida. Did you have good dreams?”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida gave an innocent smile, “yes I had lovely dreams.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida bit into the waffle, it was crispy and hot and delicious. Ida could hear her dad outside thumping about. He stomped back inside and kicked his shoes off at the door. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Dad came into the kitchen and absent mindedly put a little snack container on the kitchen table. Ida could see a few gingerbread crumbs inside the container. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    “Good morning Ida”, Dad said and gave her a kiss on the top of the head.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Dad looked hungrily at the fresh waffles and said, “hey wow those waffles smell yum, is there any chance I could have one?”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Mum smiled and pouring some fresh batter into the pan said, “coming right up, grab a seat.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Dad grabbed an empty plate and sat down next to Ida. Mum flicked out the fresh and hot waffle and put it on Dads’ plate. Dad covered the steaming hot waffle with syrup.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Chewing thoughtfully Dad said to Ida “well it looks like a little mouse got into your gingerbread.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida gave her biggest and most innocent smile to her dad and said, “I don’t mind if a mousy ate the gingerbread.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Dad said, “oh that’s good, I thought you might be worried about it.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ida smiled a secret smile and together they had a delicious breakfast. The sun was just starting to climb into the sky, and it was going to be a wonderful day.
