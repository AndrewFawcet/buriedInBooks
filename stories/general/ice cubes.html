    It was a hot day and Zoe's feet were very tired, she had been walking on them up the river all day. She had just about floated to the sea when the block of ice she was on finally melted and she was able to swim to the river bank. She was getting hungry and the sun was about to go down. Suddenly she heard a furious buzzing, it was a furious swarm of bees. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    She was a bit scared but she edged closer and saw a group of them buzzing very angrily. After a bit she could make out what they were saying. One group buzzing "yellow black yellow black", and the other group kept buzzing even louder "black yellow black yellow". The angry buzzing got louder and louder. Zoe got annoyed at them and yelled "stop this! why are you arguing." A bee landed on a leaf in front of her and explained they were arguing over the order of the stripes. Some thought they went "black yellow black yellow" and some thought they went the other way. Zoe thought that this was really stupid. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    She thought for a while and then said to one group, "I want you to say yellow", then she pointed to the other group "I want you to say black". The bees were confused at first and flew around for a bit and then some from one group started buzzing "yellow yellow". The other group quickly started buzzing "black black". They soon really got into the swing of it, taking it in turns to say their colour. They were having a lot of fun.

    The bee on the leaf in front of Zoe said "thank you very much, we have been arguing about this all day. Can we give you anything?" Zoe was very hungry and said "may I have a little honey?" The bees buzzed about this going this way and that. Suddenly they all disappeared. Zoe was a little sad at this and turned to walk a bit further up the river. There was a loud buzzing behind her. She turned around and a group of bees were carrying a huge block of honeycomb. A bunch of bees on each corner of the honeycomb, as it zig zagged crazily through the air. Zoe held out her hand, she was a bit nervous about getting stung. But the bees placed the block of honeycomb on her palm and flew away. Not one stung her.
</p>

    Zoe ate the honeycomb as she walked a bit further up the river. Once she finished she washed her sticky hands in the water. The honey felt yummy in her tummy. She was getting sleepy and the sun was setting, the clouds in the distance turning red and gold. She found a toothbrush tree and picked a toothbrush. Her Mum would be very unhappy if she didn't brush her teeth. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    After brushing her teeth she found a nice big pile of leaves and moss in a grassy clearing. Crawling inside the moss was warm and springy. It smelt of mint and flowers. She fell asleep.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    The next morning she woke up, and for a minute wondered what she was doing wrapped in springy moss. Then she remembered and jumped up in a shower of leaves and moss yelling 'HELLO DAY'. A group of rabbits nibbling at the grass was astonished at her appearing out of what they thought was just a pile of leaves. A small grey rabbit and a small white rabbit that were near her took off with such speed they left a large carrot behind.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Zoe felt a bit bad for startling the rabbits like that. So she picked up the carrot. Carefully breaking the carrot in half she placed one half where the small grey rabbit had disappeared, and the other half where the small white rabbit had disappeared. Zoe sat down and waited.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    After a few minutes she saw some small white ears pocking out of the grass. A nose pocked out of the long grass and sniffed the air. Smelling the carrot the nose quivered, and the small white rabbit bounded out and started nibbling on the bit of carrot. Crunch, nibble, crunch.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Hearing the white rabbit munching on the carrot, the small grey rabbit pocked its head out from the other side of the clearing. Seeing the other piece of carrot in front of it, it's eyes lit up huge and it bounced forward and started to munch on the other bit of carrot. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Zoe was happy watching the two small rabbits eating although she was a bit hungry herself. Her stomach gave a big rumble. Suddenly she saw a large black and white rabbit sitting in front of her. It was smiling. Well, smiling as rabbits smile by folding back their ears and crinkling up their eyes. The rabbit said to Zoe. "Thank you so much, my two kids have been arguing over that carrot for over an hour. You would think at their age they would learn to share, but nope, as soon as they see a big carrot all they want to do is eat the whole thing." She sighed. "Oh well, I'm sure they will grow up one day, can I offer you a carrot? You look a bit hungry..." Zoes stomach at this point gave another big rumble, and she nodded. "goodness me," the mother rabbit said " I'll get you some carrots." 
</p>

    The mother rabbit disappeared into the bushes and emerged with a bunch of carrots. "Here you go, we actually have too many at this time of year". Zoe smiled "thank you very much!" The two small rabbits had finished there carrot pieces, and were now chasing a butterfly. There fluffy white tails bouncing as the chased it into the bushes. The mother rabbit sighed again. "Oh well I better go chase them, before they get themselves into more trouble." and in a flash she was gone as well.

    Zoe ate the bundle of carrots the rabbit had given her. They were fresh and crunchy. Stretching in the morning sun she started walking again. She was just about back to where she had left Andrew. It was early and already the sun was getting hot.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    She was a bit cross at Andrew, he was very silly. He had accidentally dropped Jethro off at the wrong house, and felt so bad about it he had decided to live in the river. He was forgetful and silly for driving Jethro to the wrong house, but it was not so bad because Jethro was able to walk back to his house. She needed to explain this to Andrew.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Zoe walked a bit further, and could see a shape in the river. Yes it was Andrew, what a silly billy, he was still sitting in the water where she had left him yesterday. "Hellooo" Zoe yelled at Andrew, he was very wet sitting in the water. He turned and smiled at her "Hello Zoe" he yelled and waved from where he was sitting in the water. "Why are you still sitting in the river?" Zoe asked Andrew. She was going to tell him to go home. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    "I live here now. Can I get you a glass of water?" Andrew yelled to her. It was a noisy and splashy river. Zoe thought this was a very silly place to live, but she was a bit thirsty and very hot so she said "yes please!". Andrew sloshed as he stood up and pulled a glass out from his underwater glasses cabinet. He filled it with fresh river water. He was about to give it to her then said "would you like ice in your glass?". It was a very hot day and Zoe said "yes please". 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Andrew sloshed to another part of the river. He opened a large white box which was his underwater freezer he had installed in the river. The freezer had filled with water. When he opened it a huge block of ice floated out. It was the size of a small car. "Oh dear" Andrew said, the ice was much to large for the glass. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    "It's OK" yelled Zoe, and she ran and splashed over to the ice and gave it a big hug. It was a very hot day.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    The ice was nice and cool, but then Zoe noticed she was stuck to the ice. She started floating down the river. Oh no not again. She yelled at Andrew "I'll be right back when I unstick myself, but you need to stop being a silly billy and sitting in the river". Andrew could not hear her over the sound of the river. He yelled to Zoe "I can't hear you, I'll just sit and wait here until you get back." He smiled and waved.
</p>

    Zoe gave a big sigh as she floated down the river, this block of ice was going to take ages to melt.
