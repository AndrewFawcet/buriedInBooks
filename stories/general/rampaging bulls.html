    Phoebe went to check the mailbox, hopping across the hot concrete in the mid-summer sun. She stood on a patch of cool grass beside the mailbox. Leaning over shielding her eyes with the palm of her hand and squinting into the letterbox shadows. The drone of cicadas was drowned out by a terrifying roar and a crashing and a splintering. Phoebe spun around and saw a huge black bull crashing through the entranceway to the house. Phoebe let out a sigh of discontent, flicking her hair out of her eyes she ran across the lawn and took shelter on the fence to the neighbours. She heard Otis and Ava yell in unison “no! my card game. “Phoebe could see through the glass doors the bull a huge and hulking shadow moving through the house. It turned the corner and disappeared into the kitchen. She heard her Mum scream out “no! my fresh made sourdough.” Followed by a pained bellow from the bull. There was a crash as the bull ran out the front door, turned the corner and disappeared down the street.
</p>

    In the ensuing silence Phoebe sighed again. She climbed down from the fence, being careful of splinters with her bare feet. Phoebe went inside stepping past the dented and akimbo door jamb. Inside the house Ava was crying over the scattered cards in the lounge. Ava complained loudly over her tears “just when I was finally winning and beating Otis for once, a huge bull had to run through and ruin the game.” Otis thought this was very funny and laughing said “I’m not sure if you were winning, I was just momentarily taking it easy on you.” Ava balled up her hands and put her fists on her hips and gave Otis a look that would have cut through stone. This unfortunately made Otis laugh louder.

    Mum emerged from the kitchen looking a bit brassed off. Seeing cards scattered everywhere she said “Ava, Otis tidy up these cards at once! A rampaging bull is no excuse for untidy mess.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Phoebe asked her Mum “what happened in the kitchen Mum, I heard a terrific bellow?” Mum folded her arms and looked crossly at Phoebe and said “this rampaging bull just came through and ate my freshly made loaf of sourdough. It was hot and fresh from the oven and gave the bull a burnt tongue. Serves him right, he shouldn’t be in here rampaging anyway.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Mum was quite cross as she had spent over an hour making the sour dough loaf. Phoebe said “can I help you whip up another one?” Phoebe quickly disappeared into the kitchen and started throwing flour  into a bowl and spinning round in circles.
</p>

    Dad came home later, he had been out cycling to the local supermarket for three blocks of butter and two apples. When he saw the side of the front door had been bashed he frowned mightily. Dad said “tsk tsk, I just repaired the front door three days ago, and there goes another rampaging bull knocking into the front door again.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    His anger abated somewhat when he saw Phoebe emerge from the kitchen covered in flour and he smelt delicious sour dough cooking.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Phoebe smiled and said “since a rampaging bull ate the last loaf I’ve taken it upon myself to cook another one.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Dad was very happy at this and unloaded his backpack on the kitchen bench. The two apples went straight into the fruit basket, but one of the blocks of butter was flat as a pancake. Phoebe picked it up, it was yellow and perfectly flat like a frisbee. Phoebe asked “oh dear, what happened here dear Papa?”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Dad looked at the yellow butter frisbee and said gloomily “there was a brown rampaging bull at the supermarket”, he sighed, “it stood on one of my blocks of butter while  I was shopping. I wish there was a way to control these rampaging bulls, they area a dreadful nuisance. It’s just they are as big as a car, so what can you do?”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Phoebe nodded in agreement, clouds of white flour drifting out from her hair. She said “yes Papa these rampaging ulls are so annoying. We had two run through school the other day. It made learning math awfully difficult, we had to stand on our desks while the teacher shouted math problems. The rampaging bulls made so much noise it was hard to hear the teacher.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Miles shook his head at this and said “there really are too many rampaging bulls in Waterloo. If only we could figure out a way to control them.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    The oven buzzer went off and Phoebe spinning around in a  cloud of white flour took the sourdough buckwheat loaf out of the oven. She said “dear Papa come have a slice of fresh sour dough buckwheat loaf, it will make you feel so much better. Just be careful not to burn your mouth like one of those irritating rampaging bulls.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Happily Phoebe, her Dad, and the rest of the family sat down to some delicious fresh sourdough buckwheat loaf garnished with pieces of pre flattened butter frisbee. The family absolutely stuffed with delicious fresh sourdough buckwheat loaf sprawled about on various pieces of furniture for an afternoon nap.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ava woke up first, had a large glass of water and decided that it would be fun to play a game of cricket. Not wanting to wake the others still dozing she padded downstairs with a bat and ball. Smack boom, smack boom. Ava wacked the ball around downstairs, causing what she considered only minor structural damage to the walls of the house. She was having a lot of fun and gave the ball a tremendous ‘thwack’. The ball bounced off the wall and went flying down the hallway into the bathroom. The ball hit the bathroom mirror with a tremendous crash, mirrored glass flying everywhere. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    The rest of the family awoke with a jolt at the sound of shattering glass. Miles stomped down the stairs his brow heavily furrowed. He saw Ava standing in the middle of the room looking guilty trying to hide a cricket bat behind her back. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Miles brow furrowed even deeper. “Ava have you been causing extensive structural damage to the house?” he growled while looking at the extensive cricket balls holes in the walls.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ava twisted one foot behind the other “No Dad I wasn’t causing structural damage to the house, you see I was just playing cricket and putting hundreds of holes in the walls when I accidentally hit the ball down the hall. I think I broke the mirror”, Ava looked guiltily down the hallway.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Miles was very grumpy at this and said “From now on Ava I don’t want any cricket being played inside unless the door to the bathroom is closed.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ava very sadly nodded at this and said “Yes Dad, I’m sorry. But what about if I’m in the bathroom and want to smash a cricket ball around? Should I close the bathroom door?”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Miles’ brow furrowed sill further at the question and he thought for a second and said “I’m sorry Ava but I’m going to put my foot down on this. From now on I don’t want anyone to be playing cricket in the bathroom! Now lets go pick up the pieces.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Together they went and picked up the broken mirror pieces. Carefully putting the large glass shards into a plastic bag. They went back upstairs with the bag of broken glass. Miles held up the bag uncertainly and said “now how am I going to get rid of this bag of broken glass?”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Phoebe walked over in a delicate cloud of flour “I know Papa, I can put the pieces in the flour sack left over from the fresh sour dough buckwheat loaf I cooked earlier. “ She popped into the kitchen and emerged in a cloud of fresh flour with an empty flour bag. Phoebe said “if you place the pieces in here we can dispose of the glass safely.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Carefully making sure not to cut themselves they placed the mirrored shards into the flour sack. Phoebe said “I’ll just go and place this in the bin outside. I’ve just remembered I haven’t checked the mailbox , since I got so rudely interrupted by a rampaging bull last time.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Phoebe skipped out the front door carrying the flour sack full of jagged shards. Phoebe lifted the lid on the bin outside and just as she was lifting the flour sack into the bin she heard a loud huffing snort behind her, She turned her head and there was a very large red rampaging bull just behind her. She was so startled she dropped the flour sack, causing bits of broken mirror glass o cascade around her, and took a step back. Very surprisingly the red rampaging bull did not advance, instead it gave another loud snort and ran away down the street.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Phoebe was left surrounded by bits of mirrored glass. She wondered what could have scared the red rampaging bull away. Phoebe carefully picked up the flour sack and stated putting the pieces of mirrored glass back into the bag. While she was doing this she had a crazy idea. She finished picking up the broken pieces of mirror and instead of putting the flour sack in the bin she carried it back inside.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Back inside Phoebe went and pulled out the sewing machine put the flour sack down beside it, Ava saw the flour sack of broken mirror pieces and was very confused, she asked Phoebe “are you going t sew the mirror back together?"
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Phoebe replied curtly “no, I’m not sewing the mirror back together, that is impossible. You’ll have to wait and see.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Phoebe then ignoring Avas further questions went into her room and found her denim jacket. She picked it up and took it back to the sewing machine. Phoebe set to work, she spent the next hour cunningly sewing and threading bits of broken mirror onto her denim jacket. When she had finished the denim material could barley be seen, it was now a reflective jacket that tinkled and clinked when it moved.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Phobe went and put on a jumper, and then put the super reflective denim jacket on top. The jumper helped protect her skin from jagged bits of mirror poking through the jacket and cutting her.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Ava saw Phoebe walking around with her reflective jacket and said “you’ve got a very strange idea of fashion Phoebe.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Phoebe replied with a mysterious “you’ll see Ava” and went upstairs.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Upstairs Phoebe found her Mum taking the fresh cooked sourdough loaf out of the oven. Her Mum looked quizzically at the mirror jacket and said “hmmm I never will understand fashions going around this year.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Phoebe smiled sweetly and said “yes it’s the latest thing and I’ve only just made it. Now is there anything we need form the supermarket?”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Mum looked worried at Phoebe and said “well yes, ‘ve just noticed we need more salt. That dratted rampaging bull this morning tipped over the salt container. But are you going to be ok out there? There are so many rampaging bulls out today.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Phoebe said very confidently “no it’s fine Mum, I have it under control.” Phoebe picked up a bag for shopping and shucking on her sandals started walking down the street.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    The day was sunny and warm but not hot as Phoebe walked along. A few white clouds scudded along the skies and her mirror jacket tinkled and clinked as she walked, She was a bit nervous but pretty sure her idea would work.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Phobe turned the corner onto the main road and her heart skipped a beat. Standing just two letterboxes down, and busily eating someone else’s flowers, was a blue rampaging bull. Blue rampaging bulls were the worst, they had a reputation for being stubborn.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    The blue rampaging bull paused in eating the flowers and looked down the road at Phoebe, dandelions dangled from its blue maw. The blue rampaging bull snorted, pawed at the ground with blue hooves the size of dinner plates, and started to run towards Phoebe.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Phoebe stood her ground and stood glittering and immovable in her mirror jacket. The bull got closer and the terrifying hugeness of the of the rampaging blue bull made Phoebes heart beat faster. Phoebes heart skipped a beat and she squeezed her eyes shut. Phoebe heard a loud bellow and felt … nothing.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    She opened her eyes to see the backside of the blue rampaging bull as it scampered down the street and around the corner. There were half chewed dandelions dropped right at her feet. Phoebe smiled a quiet smile of victory, and with a jaunty step carried on to the supermarket.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    At the supermarket Phoebe cheerfully walked the aisles and picked up four kilograms of fresh salt for her Mum and one large pot of extra bitter marmalade for herself. At the supermarket and on the way back Phoebe met a green rampaging bull and a aqua rampaging bull. Both had the same reaction and ran away when they got close.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Phoebe skipped home untouched and unhurried. She unloaded her four kilograms of fresh salt and large pot of bitter marmalade on the kitchen bench. Her family was amazed at how she had so casually gone to the supermarket with all the rampaging bulls running about town.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    As the family stood around gawping in astonishment, Phoebe’s Mum asked “how did you so casually go to the supermarket? I was so worried about you!”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Phoebe held out her arms with a tinkling jingle, the light flashing and reflecting off the mirrored jacket, and said “well you see I made this mirror jacket and do you know why?”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    The family stood around dumbfounded, eventually Otis scratching his chin thoughtfully said “is it so you can look at planes without having to look up? Sometimes my neck gets very sore.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Phoebe shot her brother an icy look that would have frozen volcanoes. Unfortunately Otis had got distracted and was now staring out the window at a ATR 72-600 plane passing. Phoebe decided to ignore her brother, Phoebe said “it’s for reflecting bulls. The thing that scares a rampaging bull the most is an image of itself. They really are big bullies who are secretly big scaredy cats. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    The whole family was amazed at this and they celebrated Phoebe’s discovery with slices of toasted bread with thick layers of bitter marmalade and lashings of fresh salt on poured on top.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Later the family set to work smashing all the mirrors in the house and making jackets like Phoebe’s. The news of this discovery spread  and soon everyone in Waterloo was wearing a mirror jacket like Phoebe. The streets of Waterloo became safe as people walked tinkling, flashing and glittering in their mirrored jackets. The rampaging bulls grew timid with the continual reflections around them so even dandelions felt safe to grow.
