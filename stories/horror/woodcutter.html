    He strode out in the morning and after a solid day of chopping the light grew too dim to place the axe accurately. Kindling a small fire blowing on the wispy flames he coaxed a decent pile of wood to burning. When the embers had settled to a steady glow, he punched holes in the tops of cans of baked beans and corn and placed them at the edge. The cans steamed and bubbled in the heat, and he knocked them out of the embers with a short stick. Cooled slightly he ate his dinner. Rinsing out one of the cans and filling it with water he placed it back in the embers. Once heated he threw a loose handful of tea leaves into the water and bent a piece of wire around the can to act as a handle. He sipped from the can slowly cursing softly as the hot metal burnt his lips.

    He made a hammock between two trees, looping rough spun hemp rope around the trunks and stretching an old canvas sheet between. He carefully placed his axe to the side, stomped dirt on the fire, pulled his stinking boots off and reclined on the canvas sheeting with a few choice curse words. Night settled and deepened around him to the sound of his resonating snoring.

    He awoke with a jolt in the night feeling something crawling down his back. Hearing a clicking whirring sound he squinted around him in the moonlight seeing shifting sliding shadows in the trees. Feeling a prickling sensation in his hand he held it up, there were large, shadowed insects writhing over it. He shook them off and reached in his pocket for his lighter. Sparking it he saw huge wetas with a double red stripe down the back crawling around him. It was a species he had never seen before with large front mandibles and extremely sharp serrated spikes on their legs. Hearing a loud clicking whirring he looked out in the half shadows cast by the lighter. A sea of insectsâ€™ eyes stared blankly back at him, they were crawling all over the trees and ground making the whole landscape seem to shift and pulse.

    He shook the wetas off his hands his muscles tight with terror. Hearing more insects chittering away he felt them biting into the back of his head and back. Screaming he flailed at the back of his head falling out of the hammock, more insects crushed under and bit into his socked feet. Lurching forward he stood on the still hot embers and loose dirt of his fire, his holed socks sizzling and burning onto his skin. He slammed on the ground rolling screaming and scrabbling around, stamping his feet as insects chittered and clicked, crawling on the soft flesh of his body. Scrambling frantically, he tried to push the insects off his face, the biting was agonising. Pulling one off it bit deeply into his left eyeball, tearing into the white of the eye. His screaming reached a new pitch as he felt vitreous gel from his inner eyeball drip down his face leaving a salty tang. His vision dimmed as his eyeball flopped loosely.

    His body twitched and spasmed, raked by the biting venom the double-red-stripe wetas. Thrashing blindly unable to get up he screamed until his vocal cords broke, coughing blood and phlegm onto the ground. Attracted by the warmth more insects scuttled over his face forcing their way down his throat. Blinded and drowning on wetas, consciousness dimmed and faded, leaving a twitching meat sack convulsing under the swarming chittering blanket of insects.
