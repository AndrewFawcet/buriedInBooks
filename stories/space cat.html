    Once upon a time there lived four friends, a Duck, a Heron, a Zebra and a Spider. They were good friends and lived together happily on a spaceship. The spaceship was huge and shiny and flew through space like a giant steel cylinder. The spaceship was so big it has a swimming pool, a running track, and even separate spaces for people to build things and to play in.
</p>

    They all woke up early one morning and had breakfast together. For breakfast they had scrambled eggs with space cherries and chocolate sprinkles. Duck and Heron gobbled their breakfast down very quickly, Zebra was a bit more dignified and ate his breakfast slowly and carefully. Spider as usual took the longest, it seems having a total of eight arms and legs didn’t make eating faster. Spider would always have an errant arm or leg that would wander about doing something silly with his food. He took ages and made a big mess, then looked very apologetic. Murmuring “sorry, sorry” he picked up a dustpan and brush and a cleaning cloth and a broom and in a confusing whirl of arms and legs quickly cleaned up the kitchen.

    The friends sat together at the kitchen table after breakfast, they were not sure what to do with the day and each of them had different ideas. Zebra was delicately sipping a cup of tea, the fragile cup of tea was balanced perfectly between his hooves. Zebra took a little sip of tea and raised one stripy eyebrow and said “I think you know that we should all go running. This spaceship has an excellent running track, we should all spend the whole day just running round and round. “ Zebra took another sip of tea and clomped his back hooves on the ground a couple of times excited at the idea of spending the day running.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    At hearing this idea Heron, Duck and Spider rolled their eyes. (That was a lot of eye rolling as Spider has eight eyes.) Zebra was always suggesting to go running and they had already done it once this week. Heron preferred to saunter and not to run, Herons legs were spindly and not made for running. Duck had short little legs for waddling around and as Duck waddled around the race track it got awfully scary with Zebra thundering around the race track at high speed. Spider sighed in dismay, Spider definitely did not want to run. Last time they went to the running track it had taken over an hour to lace running sneakers on each of spiders many feet. And when spider went out to start running Spider had difficulty coordinating all his feet. Making all eight arms and legs move quickly in the same direction was complicated and there was always one or two feet that would get the wrong idea an step off in the wrong direction. Poor Spider would start running in a straight line and then step a bit wrong and then in whirl of legs start spinning in circles. Spider would get very flustered and would puff out his cheeks and say “oh dear oh dear” as he spun around and around. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Spider leaned forward and said “I have a better idea”, Spider paused for moment to build anticipation and tried to take an expectant sip of coffee. Unfortunately he got the arms confused and ended up lifting his shoe to his face and taking a deep sniff of it, while his other arm accidentally threw his coffee cup across the room and into the spacelock door for outside. The door opened and closed automatically and the four friends watched sadly as the coffee cup floated away towards distant galaxies. Spider coughed, and not just because his shoe was a bit stinky, and said “Oh gosh sorry about that.”  Zebra sighed and said “we need to stop throwing stuff into space, that’s the third coffee cup we’ve thrown into space this week.” Duck let out a little quack and said “it’s ok we have heaps of coffee cups”. She pointed a wing at a cupboard full of cups then Duck said “I guess we just have to hope distant galaxies don’t mind that it occasionally rains coffee cups. Anyway Spider, what were you saying?”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Spider gave a little smile and said “oh yes well I was just thinking as we have already gone running this week, how about we go jump on a web? I have some really nice ones made up.” At hearing this idea Duck, Heron and Zebra all groaned. Last time they had decided to jump on webs there had been a few complications. Zebra had eagerly jumped on a web and immediately gone crashing through and put a bit of a dent in the floor below. Luckily Zebra was not hurt, he was just a bit surprised. Duck and Heron had better luck at jumping on webs, but after a bit had become horribly entangled. Heron especially had got so entangled with a web so firmly stuck all around her wings that she was not able to go diving for a whole week. For days Heron had sat forlornly by the diving pool in the spaceship, her wings wrapped up with webs making it too dangerous to go diving.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    So Zebra put down his cup of tea and said “neigh” (even though he was not a horse) because he did not want to go crashing through another web. Duck let out a loud quacking “no” And then Heron waving her beak around clacked and cawed and said “no way.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Spider was a bit crestfallen at his idea not being an instant success, he thought webs were great and his idea was excellent. He went to make another cup of coffee, as he had thrown the last one towards a distant galaxy.  Spider murmured “oh dear, what are we going to do then? Are we able to agree about anything?”, while one arm boiled the kettle, another arm reached for the coffee beans and another arm reached into the fridge.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Heron perked up at this, clacked her beak loudly and said “I know what we can do! We can all go diving in the spaceship diving pool for fish.” Heron smiled happily, she could almost taste the fish already.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Zebra let out a loud “neigh” at this. Diving into the pool always made a huge splash for him, and secretly he was a bit scared of the fish in the diving pool, their flippers and silvery colour made him quite nervous for some reason. And the worst part was the diving pool access ladder, it was not made for hooves at all. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Spider wandered over, a fresh hot cup of coffee held firmly in one of his many arms. He murmured “yes I quite agree with Zebra on this one, underwater diving is not the thing for me.” And one of his arms scratched the back of one of his legs. He remembered how his underwater web had disintegrated in seconds, leaving him having to float about till Duck saw him and picked him up. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    They sat together at the breakfast table, they were not sure what to do with their day. Duck nibbling on a delicious fried worm made a loud “quack” and said “I know what we should do! Not all of us want to do running, and not all of us want to do diving, and not all of us want to jump around on webs, so what we could all do is have a paddle about in the swimming pool!” Duck was very happy at this idea and she hopped about on her webbed feet while waggling her tail. Splashing about in the swimming pool was Ducks favourite activity and she really hoped the others would like the idea.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Zebra tapped his hooves and said “what a great idea”, he found the big diving pool a bit big and scary, but the swimming pool was just right. It was not so deep so he could touch the bottom, and getting in and out of the swimming pool was easy, he could just go into the shallow end and hop out.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Heron of course was super keen on any idea involving water. Although the swimming pool wasn’t as big as her favourite the diving pool, it was still a bit splashy, and anything splashy was great to her. She clacked her beak  and said “yes, yes, yes lets all go to the swimming pool.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Spider took a careful sip of his coffee, making sure to use the correct arm and not sniff his shoe again. He murmured “umm well its just that I don’t mean to be a nuisance” and he thought about how because he was small the swimming pool was still quite big. One arm which happened to be attached to a foot scratched the back of his head with a sneaker. He suddenly had a bright idea, he remembered the rafters above the swimming pool which were just perfect for making a big spider web between. He could dangle above the swimming pool bouncing on his web, and if he made it just right he could bounce on one of his webs and just be able to dip his toes in the water. This could be really fun! Spider said to everyone’s surprise “gosh yes guys, lets go to the swimming pool.” He jumped up and went to put his coffee cup away, but accidentally put a sneaker in the dishwasher instead, and in a confusion of arms and legs ran out of the room.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Duck was very very happy at everyone agreeing to her idea and with a “quack quack” here and a “quack quack” there waddled after Spider on her webbed feet. Heron was just happy that today was going to involve something splashy, so Heron quickly ran after Duck, and was closely followed by Zebra trotting out the room.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    They arrived together at the swimming pool room and in various ways started to have fun. Zebra trotted around the shallow end snorting happily as the water sloshed around his hooves. Heron of course jumped straight into the deep end where she practiced doing lengths underwater. Duck had great fun paddling around the middle of the pool, splashing water everywhere with her webbed feet. Spider found for some odd reason he was holding an empty coffee cup and carefully put it to the side while wondering where one of his sneakers had gone. He then with amazing dexterity climbed up the wall and started to make a splendid web up in the rafters.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    The spaceship continued to fly through space and through the window to the swimming pool room the four friends could see the stars floating by. It was very peaceful. Spider was happily bouncing up and down on a perfect web he had made above the water, where he could just dip his toes in. Zebra was in the shallow end of the pool splashing back and forth and feeling quite proud of himself for being so brave in the water. Duck was in the middle of the pool doing shallow dives and really enjoying the feeling of water running down the feathers of her back. At the deepest part of the deep end of the pool Heron was diving and swimming along the bottom of the pool, unusually for a heron her favourite place deep underwater.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    They were having so much fun. Spider called down to Zebra as he bounced above the pool “hey Zebra! who likes ice cream?” Zebra paused his splashing in the shallow end and a big smile came over his face.  Zebra said “I do, I really love ice cream. Hey Duck! Who likes ice cream?” Duck who had just popped out of the water from a shallow dive quacked in delight. Duck said “I do, I really love ice cream.” Duck then poked her head underwater and said in underwater bubble speak to Heron deep below “Hey Heron who likes ice cream?” Heron came shooting up from the very bottom of the pool and she said “I do! I really really love ice cream. Let’s go get ice cream.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    The four friends hopped out of the water and stood on the side of the pool drying off. They were all very excited about the idea of eating ice cream, there was a huge tub of spicy chilli and broccoli flavoured ice-cream in the kitchen that they all loved. Duck was just shaking off the last of the water off her tail, and she looked out the window at the distant stars, she was very happy. Suddenly she saw Cat whizzing by outside like a cannon ball. Duck let out a scared quack and pointed a wing “look everybody there is Cat flying through space. How did she get out there? I was not involved.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Zebra who was just finishing rubbing himself down with a towel looked out the window and said “Wowzers that’s Cat out there flying along like a cannon ball. How on Earth? I was not involved.” Heron who was flapping her wings dry clacked her beak in alarm and said “oh gosh oh gosh I was not involved.” Spider who after getting down off his web was just finishing putting on his sneakers (a somewhat complex operation involving figuring out which were his feet,) said “oh dear oh dear oh dear, maybe we should do something?” 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Duck quacked in agreement and she said “yes we need to help Cat! Lets put on our spacesuits and help her.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    The four friends ran to the kitchen and very quickly put on their spacesuits. Even Spider who normally took forever to put on his spacesuit did a flip jump and put all eight arms and legs into his spacesuit at the same time. They put their space helmets on and special magnet space shoes, so they would stick to the spaceship outside. With a quick check all around and a thumbs up that everyone was good to go, the four friends opened the door to outer space, (the airlock) and stepped outside.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    It was quite scary out in space. Even though the space ship was a big one with a swimming pool and a kitchen, the spaceship felt tiny in the vastness of space. The four friends stood on the side of the spaceship with their magnetic boots on, they felt very small. They looked up and far above their heads they saw Cat flying along like a cannon ball. Duck quacked in alarm and said “Cat is so far away we can’t get to her safely we need rope or something.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Spider looked worried and said “perhaps I can help, I can make super fine web rope.” Spider immediately set to making fine web rope very fast. His arms and legs which often seemed to have a life of their own all coordinated to make fine web rope. This task Spider could do very well. 
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Duck said “I can make it part of the way, but I don’t think I can make it all the way out to Cat. What can we do?”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Heron looked at Cat in the distance and very bravely she said “I think if you go halfway out Duck, then I can dive past you and fly out to where Cat is.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Zebra nodded his head and said “that is very brave Heron, I’ll hold the web rope at this end and use all of my Zebra weight to make sure you don’t fly away.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    With the plan sorted out the friends organised. Spider tied one end of the fine web rope around Zebras middle, then halfway down the rope ties a special Spider knot around Duck’s foot, and the other end he ties to Heron’s foot. Spider said “oh do be careful.” He had made heaps of fine web rope very fast and was very tired.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Duck took off first carrying part of the fine web rope with her. She flew and flew and got very far away. She was floating far out in space but could still see Cat even further out in space.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Zebra braced himself with each hoof in a magnetic boot stuck firmly to the spaceship. Zebra said “I’m ready if you are Heron.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Heron stood poised and silent calculating distances. She spread her wide wings and in sudden rush of feathers she took off. She flew and she flew. Heron got to where Duck was and flew past, she was very far out in space. The fine web rope had been tied carefully around Herons leg, long and thin it connected her to Duck far behind her and then to Zebra on the spaceship. Heron flew and flew, her wide wings flapping through the inky blackness of space.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    On the spaceship Zebra was getting concerned as they were running out of fine web rope. Duck at the halfway point was worried about how far away Heron was getting, Heron flew and flew, flapping with each feather to get to Cat.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Heron closed the distance to Cat as Cat tumbled through space. With one last flap just as she was about to run out of fine web rope, she made it. She bumped into Cat and wrapped her wings around her.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Cat said “thank you thank you” holding onto Heron very tightly. Heron gasped for breath in her spacesuit, she was tired. Together they turned around. Heron said “no problem Cat, hold onto my legs and I’ll fly us back.” Heron spread her wings and started the long journey back to the spaceship. Duck seeing that Heron now had Cat also started to flap back to the spaceship as well. Zebra and spider on the spaceship helped by pulling in the fine web rope.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    It took a long long time to pull the fine web rope in, but finally all five were together on the side of the spaceship. Carefully as they were all tired they went into the space door, they took off their spacesuits and collapsed into seats in the kitchen. Phew what a long day.
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Duck noticed that Cat was holding something in her paws, and asked “what’s that you are holding Cat?”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Cat looking a bit sheepish showed them, it was Spiders cup of coffee he had accidentally thrown into space. Feeling a bit silly Cat said “I was just getting up from my mid morning nap, which I have just after my early morning nap, and before my mid day nap, when I saw something fly past the window. I didn’t see it clearly and thought it was a ball of twine. Before I had time to think I had jumped into a spacesuit and was leaping out the space door after it.”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Spider looking embarrassed said “oh deary me, that was my coffee cup I accidentally threw into space.” Spider scratched the back of his head thoughtfully and said “perhaps we should all relax and enjoy some broccoli and chilli ice-cream?”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    All the friends were very happy at this idea and neighed and quacked loudly in approval. Cat piped up and asked “would I be able to cover my broccoli and chilli ice-cream in fish oil?”
</p>
<p class = storytext>
    Duck of course said “yes, lets all cover our broccoli and chilli ice-cream with fish oil.” All the friends were even happier at that idea and neighed, quacked and meowed in appreciation. They each had big bowls of broccoli and chilli ice-cream covered with a thick layer of fish oil. They enjoyed eating together as the stars outside the window slowly moved past.
